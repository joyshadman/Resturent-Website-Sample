## Customization

*   **Tailwind CSS:** Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file to change the default theme, colors, and fonts.
*   **CSS:** Add custom CSS styles in the `css/style.css` file to override or extend the Tailwind CSS styles.
*   **HTML:** Update the HTML content in the `index.html` file to reflect your desired content.
